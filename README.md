# DumsorVisualization
Visualization web app for dumsor


Jake: So I just saw that you added me to this. I have been working on something very similar on the side. I wanted to let you know that with html you dont have to have the javascript files separate, they can actually be embedded in the html webpage using the <script> ... </script> tags. It makes managing everything a little easier in my opinion, but this is just preference. If you'd like, I can link you what I have so far if you haven't seen it already.

Sid: Sorry about adding you to this so late. I created this and started working on it after I last visited, but it didn't occur to me that to add you until recently. Communication seems to have went down as well since as far as I know none of the other high schoolers were visiting or attending hangout calls. For the most part I've been the only one working on it, but another student named Ben wanted to help, but first really wanted to know about the backend before doing anything. I would definitely like to to see what you've done so far for the visualization.
