Jake: So I just saw that you added me to this. I have been working on something very similar on the side. I wanted to let you know that with html you dont have to have the javascript files separate, they can actually be embedded in the html webpage using the <script> ... </script> tags. It makes managing everything a little easier in my opinion, but this is just preference. If you'd like, I can link you what I have so far if you haven't seen it already.
